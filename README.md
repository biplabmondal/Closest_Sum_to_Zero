# Closest Sum to Zero

**Introduction**

This project focuses on solving the problem of finding two integers in a list whose sum is closest to zero. The solution is designed to handle both positive and negative integers efficiently, ensuring accurate results for a wide range of input scenarios.

**Problem Statement**

Given a list of integers (positive and negative), identify two elements such that their sum is closest to zero. The solution is robust against edge cases, including empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with duplicate values.

**Implementation Details**

**Approach**
1. Sorting: The input list is sorted to enable efficient pair evaluation.
2. Two-Pointer Technique: Iteratively evaluate pairs to find the closest sum to zero.
3. Edge Case Handling: The implementation accounts for scenarios such as empty or single-element lists.

**Tools and Techniques**
* Python: Implemented in Python using the Jupyter Notebook platform.
* Sorting Algorithm: Achieves a time complexity of O(n log n).
* Constant Space Usage: Ensures minimal memory overhead.

**Results**
* The solution efficiently identifies the pair with the closest sum to zero.
* Validated against multiple test cases, including large datasets, ensuring reliability and accuracy.

**Recommendations**

* For larger datasets, explore parallel sorting techniques to improve performance further.
* Integrate the algorithm into broader systems requiring optimization or data analysis.
